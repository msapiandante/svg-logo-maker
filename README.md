# svg-logo-maker

## Description

I was tasked with building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as a .svg file. I continued to learn how to navigate node.js. I learned how to create new objects using constructor functions as well as implement classes to create new instances of objects. 


## Credits
Shout out to my instructor Leif and TA Fred for offering their time, patience and encouragement as I continue to practice a growth mindset.
